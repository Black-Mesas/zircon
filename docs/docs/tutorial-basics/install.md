# Installing for TypeScript
Zircon at this point in time is a Roblox TypeScript library, and thus can be installed into an existing roblox-ts project using:


## From NPM
```bash
npm i @rbxts/zircon @rbxts/log
```

The `@rbxts/log` library is optional, however recommended if you're planning to use this console for debugging via logging. Zirconium itself is internal to the console so is not an external requirement.
